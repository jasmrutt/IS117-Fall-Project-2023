                    <p>
                        At new Jersey Institute of Technology, Jasmin Rutter has taken a variety of courses.
                        To name a few, she has taken networking, website development,
                        and management. 
                        She was originally attracted to NJIT because of the diverse majors they offered.
                        Not many colleges have offered Information Technology as a major and she was
                        interested in pursuing that interest. Over the course of her time at NJIT thus far,
                        she is proud to say that she has learned a great deal of information.
                        Below is a detailed description of all the courses I have taken each semester.
